# Privacy Policy for Vacation Photos

**Last Updated: December 21, 2024**

## Overview

Vacation Photos ("the App") is designed to help you view and organize your vacation memories. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the App accesses and how it is used.

## Data We Access

### Photo Library
- The App accesses your device's photo library to identify and display photos taken away from your home location.
- Photos are processed entirely on your device.
- We do not upload, copy, or transmit your photos to any server.

### Location
- The App requests your current location once to determine your "home" location.
- This is used to calculate which photos were taken more than 50 miles from home.
- Your location is stored only on your device and is never transmitted externally.

## Data Storage

- All data (cached photo metadata, home location) is stored locally on your device.
- No data is sent to external servers.
- No accounts or sign-ins are required.

## Data Sharing

- We do not collect any personal information.
- We do not share any data with third parties.
- We do not use any analytics or tracking services.

## Your Rights

- You can revoke photo or location permissions at any time in your device Settings.
- Deleting the App removes all locally stored data.

## Children's Privacy

This App does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.
