# 2025-12-19 - Project Kickoff

## Starting Fresh
- Created new Expo project for vacation photos app
- Basic idea: automatically cluster photos by location when traveling

## Core Features Built
- Photo library access with expo-media-library
- Location-based clustering using reverse geocoding
- Home location detection (most frequent photo location)
- Basic UI with vacation cards showing location thumbnails

## Build Setup
- Added EAS configuration for iOS builds
- Set up bundle identifier: `com.swapp1990.vacationphotos`
- Renamed from generic name to "Vacation Photos"

## Photo Caching
- Photos were loading slowly, especially thumbnails
- Added caching layer to avoid re-fetching same photos
- Refactored components to be more reusable

## End of Day
- App can scan photos, identify vacations, show them in cards
- Ready to test on real device tomorrow
