# 2026-01-18 - App Clip Build Fixes

## EAS Build Kept Failing
- Missing Preview Content directory - created it
- Missing App Icon - added Images.xcassets
- iOS deployment target too low - bumped to 15.1
- Version mismatch between app and App Clip

## The Version Problem
- CFBundleVersion in App Clip didn't match main app
- Tried updating Info.plist - didn't work
- Tried build hooks - ran too early
- Root cause: `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES` ignores Info.plist
- Fix: set `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` in build settings

## Build Finally Worked!

## Testing App Clip - Nothing Works
- Set up Local Experiences - no Invoke button
- Made QR code - opened in browser, no App Clip card
- Pasted URL in Safari - just 404

## Hard Truth
- Dev builds don't include App Clip target
- Need TestFlight + App Store Connect to test
- Local Experiences is basically broken

## Documentation
- Rewrote APP_CLIP.md as full tutorial
- Added all build errors and fixes
