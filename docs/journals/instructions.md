# Journal Writing Guide

Write entries as a developer journal, not technical documentation. Keep it chronological - what you tried, what failed, what worked, in the order it happened. Use short bullet points under topic headings. Capture the journey including dead ends and pivots, not just the final working solution. One file per day, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Keep entries concise - aim for quick readability, not comprehensive detail.
