# 2026-01-14 - Navigation Bug

## Year View Problem
- Tapping vacation card in year view did nothing
- Cluster detail view wasn't opening

## Investigation
- Year view was intercepting touch events
- Navigation state was getting confused

## Fix
- Adjusted touch handling in year collapsible sections
- Cluster detail view now opens correctly from any view

## Quick day
- Single bug fix, but was blocking core functionality
