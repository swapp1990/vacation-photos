# 2025-12-21 - App Store Prep

## Release 1.0.0
- Marked the first official release
- Basic vacation photo clustering works

## App Store Requirements
- Apple needs a build number, not just version
- Added `buildNumber: "1"` to app.json
- Created privacy policy page (required for photo access)

## Onboarding Flow
- App was confusing without explanation
- Added welcome screens explaining what the app does
- Created screenshot capture script for App Store listing

## Build Issues
- First build rejected - needed build number increment
- Bumped to 1.0.1 (build 2)
- Resubmitted to TestFlight

## Lessons
- Always increment build number, not just version
- Privacy policy URL must be accessible before submission
