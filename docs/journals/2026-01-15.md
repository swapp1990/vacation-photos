# 2026-01-15 - WhatsApp Sharing

## Feature Request
- Users want to share vacation photos with friends
- WhatsApp is the most common way to share

## Version Bump
- New feature = new version
- Bumped to 1.1.0

## Contacts Picker
- Need to pick who to share with
- Added expo-contacts for contact list access
- Search/filter contacts by name
- Show contact photo if available

## WhatsApp Integration
- Used Linking API to open WhatsApp
- Pre-filled message with vacation details
- Format: "I'm sharing my Paris vacation with you!"

## Challenge: Photos
- Can't actually share photos via WhatsApp API
- Only text messages supported programmatically
- Need a different approach for the photos themselves

## End of Day
- Can send text message via WhatsApp
- Photos still only on sender's device
- Tomorrow: figure out how to actually share the photos
